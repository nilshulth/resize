Description of the project: README.md
Tech stack: TECH.md

This is a hobby project. Avoid all unnecessary complexity. Try to keep the code simple and easy to understand. If there is a choice between using a library and writing code yourself, always choose to write code yourself at least if you only use the library for one or two things.
